# android-testing-examples

Android testing examples repository where I (or if any contributor) would be sharing android testing examples written using testing frameworks.

There are some testing libraries/frameworks which we can use for writing Android unit test and Instrumentation test. Some of them are:

- JUnit
- Espresso
- EasyMock/PowerMock/Mockito
- Robolectric
